<h4>Idea of plugin</h4>
The basic idea of plugin for product detail page is : as per current product page, the plugin will find out the list of past order and order purchased products.
Out of the purchased products list, the most popular products mean the products which purchased in more & more orders will display at top. like wise less popular and so on...
So user can get idea for popularity combination of current product to but other products easily. 

The main thing for past order is the product should be purchased with more then products in the order list then only the plugin will display bought together product list.
The bought together products should be more than 4 to display "Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought" on product detail and cart page.
"Frequently Bought Together" will display only on product detail page not on cart page.

Same way on cart page, the plugin will find the products selected in the cart and as per products it will get past order list and popular product and display the most popular proudcts in the order.
